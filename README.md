# simple-idm-solid

## Overview

simple-idm-solid is an open-source SolidJS UI component library providing ready-to-use authentication UIs — login, registration, password reset, and MFA — designed for seamless integration with simple-idm￼, a Go-based identity management and OIDC provider.

This project enables developers to easily embed identity workflows into any SolidJS, SolidStart, or Astro application without rebuilding authentication flows.
